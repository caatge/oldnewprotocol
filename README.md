## what's this?

Another one of my great 3am ideas that turned out to *actually* work. This allows you to connect to Source 2006 servers using a Source 2004 client and host servers that are joinable from both engine versions.

## why?
* 3 AM boredom
* i hate myself
* broken NPC animations on some Source 2004 mods when ran on 2006
* VGUI friends in the menu

## compatibility

### when joining a game

| engine version | latest can join |
| - | - |
| 2707 | 4044 |
| 2687 | 4044 |
| 2672 | 4044 |
| 2651 | 4044 |
| 2643 | 4044 |
| 2639 | 4044 |
| 2629 | 4044 |
| 2596* | 4044 |
| 2578* | 4044 |
| 2547* | 4044 |
| 2545* | 4044 |
| 2536* | 4044 |
| 2519* | 4044 |
| 2516* | 4044 |
| 2515* | 4044 |
| 2512* | 4044 |
| 2511* | 4044 |
| 2497* | 4044 |

\* - Steam auth is broken so you will not be able to join Steam servers

### hosting servers will work at some point i hope
### you should be able to host a 2707 joinable server from 4044 using this, ~~however expect your client to crash as soon as you connect to a newer server~~ idk it started working

## compiling

* Clone recursively
* Open the solution in Visual Studio 2022
